# Teams

This project was started mid-way through my course with EDA. The project uses technologies we were taught at EDA such as React and Redux.

## Overview

This has been a pet project of mine over the past two months. Being a keen social indoor football play I wanted a fair solution to the age old tradition of picking teams. The application orginally started to sort people entered into the database into two teams. However, my ideas have grown since then and I am working to add some further functionality. My goals for the Teams application include:
- sorting people into multiple teams (more than two)
- the ability to choose team names
- styling all pages
- testing for all components
- and, so it looks cool, a p5 moving background (I have never used p5 before but I am keen to use this creative library)

## Getting Started

To run the application follow the steps below:
- 1: On the main repo page click on the green 'code' button and clone the repo into your local git 
- 2: Once cloned to your local git, run the appilcation via localhost:3000 using the command 'npm run dev'
- 3: Have fun checking it out and feel free to leave me some feedback! Enjoy :-)
