# Teams

This project was started mid-way through my course with EDA. The project uses technologies we were taught at EDA such as React and Redux. For testing I used Jest, react testing library and self-taught myself Cypress so I could learn about this awesome e2e testing library.

## Overview

This has been a pet project of mine over the past two months. Being a keen social indoor football play I wanted a fair solution to the age old tradition of picking teams. The application orginally started to sort people entered into the database into two teams. However, my ideas have grown since then and I am working to add some further functionality. My goals for the Teams application include:
- sorting people into multiple teams (more than two) 
- styling all pages
- testing testing testing! Having a background in aviation where safety to paramount, I love testing and knowing what my application is up to!
- CI/CD
- and, so it looks cool, a p5 moving background (I have never used p5 before but I am keen to use this creative library)
