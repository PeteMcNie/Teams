# Teams

This project was started mid-way through my course with EDA. The project uses technologies we were taught at EDA such as React and Redux. For testing I used Jest, react testing library and self-taught myself Cypress so I could learn about this awesome e2e testing library.

## Overview

This has been a pet project of mine over the past two months. Being a keen social indoor football play I wanted a fair solution to the age old tradition of picking teams. The application orginally started to sort people entered into the database into two teams. However, my ideas have grown since then and I am working to add some further functionality. My goals for the Teams application include:
- sorting people into multiple teams (more than two) 
- styling all pages
- testing testing testing! Having a background in aviation where safety to paramount, I love testing and knowing what my application is up to!
- CI/CD
- and, so it looks cool, a p5 moving background (I have never used p5 before but I am keen to use this creative library)

## Testing

I quick word on testing. I am proud of the coverage of my testing and really enjoyed learning about and writing tests for the app. I will be implementing tests in other projects as I create them to gain further understanding of testing liraries. If you would like to see some of my tests in action follow these steps:
- 1: On the main repo page click on the green 'code' button and clone the repo into your local git 
- 2: In your terminal run the command 'npm install'
- 3: In your terminal type the command 'npm run test' (Unit and snapshot tests)
- 4: In your terminal type the command  'npx cypress open'. A cypress will open in a new window, on the right handside near the top you should see blue words saying 'Run all specs'. Click these words and watch the end-2-end tests run. (e2e tests) You are able to run the same cypress tests in your terminal without openning the cypress window by using the command 'npx cypress run'...you don't get to watch the action though which is half the fun!
